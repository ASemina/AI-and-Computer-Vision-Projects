# AI-and-Computer-Vision-Projects

This repository contains three projects all completed close in time and with similar natures. 
The first project is a series of Neural Nets/Regression models created in Python. 
The next project is for identifying a hand and hand gestures using the OpenCV library in Python.
The final project is a simple game AI designed to play Atropos, a game based on Sperner's Lemma.
